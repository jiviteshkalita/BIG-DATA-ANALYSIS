Description : 
This project was implemented using Jupyter Notebook, a popular open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is a core component of many data science workflows and is widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and research.
Objective:
The main objective of this task is to:

Analyze the data to discover key patterns and insights using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Build a predictive machine learning model that classifies whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (y column as target variable).

Key Workflow Steps:
Data Import and Inspection:

The CSV file is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

Basic structure and shape of the dataset are examined.

Data types and missing values are checked to ensure data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of categorical features like job, marital, education, and contact are analyzed.

Bar plots and value counts are used to understand how these features are related to the target variable y.

Some numerical attributes like age, balance, and duration are likely visualized using histograms and box plots to detect outliers and understand skewness.

Data Preprocessing:

Categorical variables are encoded using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.

Feature scaling may be applied to numeric attributes for better performance in certain algorithms.

The dataset is split into features (X) and target (y), and then into training and test sets using train_test_split.

Model Building:

A classification algorithm (most likely Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Decision Tree) is trained on the training set.

The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Prediction and Evaluation:

The trained model is tested on unseen data (test set).

The confusion matrix and classification report give insights into how well the model performs in distinguishing between subscribers and non-subscribers.

Applications:
Banking Sector: This task is highly applicable in marketing strategy planning for banks. It helps identify which type of customers are more likely to respond positively to telemarketing.

Customer Targeting: Marketing teams can optimize campaigns by targeting the right customers and reducing costs.

Churn Prediction: Similar modeling techniques can be applied to predict customer churn or loan default.

Personalized Campaigns: Enables banks to personalize their approach to customer acquisition and retention.
